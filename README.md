Title: Multilevel feedback queue Scheduler using GUI
---------------------------------------------------------

Aim
---
To implement a multilevel feedback queue scheduler using Round Robin and FCFS algorithm

Implementation
--------------
Source inclues 3 main files
1. Main.java - This contains the method from which the execution starts. Includes Roundrobin algorithm as well as FCFS algorithm for scheduling
2. PCB.java -  This is basically Process control block class structure to represent each process. It has all the properties necessary for a process
3. MainJFrame.java - This class is include all the GUI components

How to Run
----------
Two ways to run the program:
1. Using jar - Included jar file named "Bennet_1009221_Project1.jar" which can be executed directly
2. Using IDE - Please use Netbeans IDE to import the project named "Bennet_1009221_Project1"

Performance Evaluation
----------------------
Permorance evaluation is displayed on the screen such as average waiting time, turn around time and response time.

Bugs
----
None

Limitations & Assumption
-------------------------
By default 20 process is being created, the limit can be easily extended.

Conclusion
----------
The Multilevel feeddback has been successfully implemented with graphical user interface
